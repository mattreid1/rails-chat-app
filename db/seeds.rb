Post.create(:title => "Labour looses", :content => "Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have apologised over Labour's \"catastrophic\" defeat in Thursday's election, which saw them lose 59 seats. Mr Corbyn said he was \"sorry that we came up short\", while Mr McDonnell told the BBC he \"owns this disaster\". The leader and shadow chancellor said they would step down in the new year. The race for their replacements has already begun, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy saying for the first time she was \"seriously thinking about\" running. Mr McDonnell said it would be up to Labour's National Executive Committee to decide the mechanics of the leadership election, but he expected it to take place in eight to 10 weeks' time. Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935 on Thursday and saw its vote share fall by eight points. The Conservatives won a Commons majority of 80 - the party's biggest election win for 30 years - sweeping aside Labour in its traditional heartlands.

Some of them have been in nonstop rotation since the late 1980s; there are few crumple zones or crash restraints inside even the most whimsical magical cat; and the aggressive behavior of cat buses in traffic is usually overlooked due to the perceived importance of, say, getting children to their dying mother's bedside or what have you. The city should really adopt the junior witch rideshare program they use in Kyoto. Commuters would gladly pay more to take a daily magical journey through the sky if it meant I could get to work on time for once.\" Tokyo officials are advising commuters to take the train out of the city in the evening instead and have assured hesitant riders that all rail lines have been fully fumigated after last year's infestation of No-Faces. https://www.theonion.com/tokyo-drivers-gridlocked-as-12-legged-catbus-overturns-1840414881")
